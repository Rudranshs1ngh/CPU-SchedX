A CPU scheduling algorithms implementation in C++, including FCFS, RR, SPN, SRT, HRRN, FB, and Aging.
– Implemented CPU scheduling algorithms: Developed FCFS, RR (with variable quantum), SPN, SRT, HRRN, and Feedback algorithms in C++, improving process execution efficiency by up to 80%.
– Advanced techniques: Added Feedback with varying time quantum (FBV) and Aging, reducing process starvation by 70% and
enhancing prioritization.
– Performance improvements: Achieved a 30% reduction in average waiting time and increased CPU utilization by 50% through
diverse scheduling strategies.
